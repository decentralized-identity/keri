# Weekly Q&A for KERI novices

Goal is to facilitate self-education in KERI. Level: starters, novices, beginners and alike. Some digital self sovereign identity experts could have their blinders removed by taking part too. 

## Why
Spread the word about this ground-breaking technology and Universal Identifier theory.

## Who
Current team members are busy programming. We should not disturb them too much. We might call on non-programming volunteers that have advanced fudamental knowledge.

## Use of English
For Central Europeans a non-native proficient use of English could be satisfactory. 

Personally I think it is *not* a good idea to have KERI theory translated into Spanish, Mandarin, etc. KERI theory sounds like English, but it's not and we'll create even more hurdles to overcome when we translate to another foreign language. (+1 from Juan Caballero, who worked as a professional translator in the past.  these texts will NOT translate well, much less google-translate well!)


### Native speaking
Maybe a **non-native speaker is better** than native speakers from the UK, Canada or the US because native speakers in a complex technology field tend to use hard to grasp constructions?

For US, Canada and UK, we might need to record a native speaker to come across more convincingly. But in that case we need to be careful that the wording is simple and understandable for laymen.

## How it's done
Presentation skills and practise will certainly help to bring the message across smoothly.

### Pre-recorded video play and text chat

First we play a video for first timers, and **in the meanwhile we'll be available on the chat for guidance and first answers** and after this prerecorded video with text-chat option we'll go over to interactive Q&A.

*first 1/2 hr*

### Full-swing Zoom Q&A and text chat

We could open up on Zoom with other interested Newbies who join in later (because they've already seen the pre-recorded stuff) 

for live discussion and Q&A, of course with a host that repeats questions posed in the chat and gives the person that has sent in the question the opportunity to repeat the question with voice & vid. We've tested this concept in the Netherlands and it went well.

*second 1/2 hr*

### Example program bi-weekly

So the example program could be:
```
Wednesday 4 PM CEST Pre-recorded video play and text chat

Wednesday 4:30 PM CEST Zoom Q&A and text chat, **this week's topics only!** 
```

### Repetition every 8 weeks
The whole series will be repeated and revised every 8 weeks. New tutors can be trained (train the teacher) and within 2 month play a role in teaching others.

## Supportive resources
When somebody finds our 'KERI for novices" in the middle of an ongoing series, then there are two options:
1. work backwards in high speed
2. wait until the next series

### Backward learning
We will have more than one video of half an hour pre-recording of which the text-chat will also be recorded. And the Q&A will also be recorded.

To facilitate catching up for people that want to hop on the bandwagon the latest series will be available publicly as Zoom recording.

### Further reading
Every lesson will have sufficient links to Keri.one resources, but the level of abstraction should be high. We do not want to chase people away with complexity and vastness of the field KERI has to cover. Keep it simple, stupid.

### Legal issues
We can only re-use or create Open Source course material, e.g. CC by SA 

### Example video 

#### Future Internet Identity 
This example is a general introduction about the why of autonomic IDs and tries to put listeners to work at the end. We could also focus more specific on KERI in future recordings or even the relationship between KERI and DIDs, KERI and other algorithmic and autonomic ID systems.

Henk van Cann's presentation about (the why of) autonomic identifiers called: "You control, therefore you are, and you get to decide" https://vimeo.com/552459966/2586f0e23c. 

It is a first-time, one-take presentation based on this article: https://medium.com/happy-blockchains/you-control-therefore-you-are-and-you-get-to-decide-2e2e615714a9. 

## When?
As soon as possible, but it's done when it's done.

#### First steps to take:
1. Gather open source course material to reference for further reading
2. Write high abstraction level articles which have a narative flow
3. Practise presenting the content of the articles
4. Professionally record the first three half hour pre-recorded vids
5. Get the series started and see where we get
