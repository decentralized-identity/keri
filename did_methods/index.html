    <p>KERI provides a means for secure and decentralised key management. This specification defines a DID method based
        on KERI.</p>
</section>
<section id="sotd">
</section>
<section class="informative">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure is a system for secure self-certifying Identifiers which aims at minimum
        sufficiency and maximum security. It defines mechanisms for proving the Root of Trust for self-certifying
        Identifiers and their associated Key State. This spec defines a transform from Key State to DID Document, such
        that any valid Key Event Log can be processed into a DID Document.</p>

    <p>A close analogy is <tt>did:peer</tt>, except that where the data model of <tt>did:peer</tt> is a DID Document and JSON patches on
        said Document, the basic data model of <tt>did:keri</tt> is an append-only log of Key Events. KERI-based
        Identifiers are suitable for both any-wise and n-wise purposes.</p>

</section>
<section class="normative">
    <h2>Concepts</h2>


    <section class="normative">
        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>
            A Key Event is an atomic transaction over the Key State of an Identifier. While all events have some
            semantic meaning within KERI, only a subset will change the keys in a Key State (rotation and delegated rotation).
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="normative">
        <h3>Key Event Log</h3>
        <p>
            The Key Event Log is a type of hash-chained data structure from which the Key State of an Identifier can be
            derived. It can always be used to recreate the state at any point ("event-sourcing").
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="normative">
        <h3>Key Event Receipt Log</h3>
        <p>
            The Key Event Receipt Logs are built from receipts of events signed by the witnesses of those events (these
            are called <code>commitments</code>); these are also append-only but not hash-chained.
        </p>

    </section>
    <section class="normative" id="keyState">
        <h3>Key State</h3>
        <p>
            Key State represents the current values for the keys, witnesses and thresholds for a given identifier, signed by a provider.
            The signature from the provider signifies that the provider has verified the KEL for the identifier and the result of that
            verification is the key state.  The key state is represented in a Key State Notification Message detailed fully in
            <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0003.md#key-state-messages">Event Serialization Key State Messages</a>.
            The following fields are defined for a Key State Notification Message:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>v</code>:	Version String</li>
                <li><code>i</code>: Identifier Prefix</li>
                <li><code>s</code>:	Sequence Number</li>
                <li><code>t</code>:	Message Type</li>
                <li><code>d</code>:	Event Digest (Seal or Receipt)</li>
                <li><code>p</code>:	Prior Event Digest</li>
                <li><code>kt</code>: Keys Signing Threshold</li>
                <li><code>k</code>:	List of Signing Keys (ordered key set)</li>
                <li><code>n</code>:	Next Key Set Commitment</li>
                <li><code>wt</code>: Witnessing Threshold</li>
                <li><code>w</code>:	List of Witnesses (ordered witness set)</li>
                <li><code>wr</code>: List of Witnesses to Remove (ordered witness set)</li>
                <li><code>wa</code>: List of Witnesses to Add (ordered witness set)</li>
                <li><code>c</code>:	List of Configuration Traits/Modes</li>
                <li><code>a</code>:	List of Anchors (seals)</li>
                <li><code>da</code>: Delegator Anchor Seal in Delegated Event (Location Seal)</li>
                <li><code>di</code>: Delegator Identifier Prefix in Key State</li>
                <li><code>rd</code>: Merkle Tree Root Digest</li>
                <li><code>e</code>:	Last received Event Map in Key State</li>
                <li><code>ee</code>: Last Establishment Event Map in Key State</li>
                <li><code>vn</code>: Version Number ("major.minor")</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Key state notification messages differ depending on whether
            the signer is using a delegated identifier.  The follow examples detail the fields needed for each permutation.

            The following field MAY appear in a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID document: <code>verificationMethod</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-normative note: multiple namespaces using the same DID method could prove control or replay history for one
            controlling keypair that has been used across multiple ledgers. KERL logs could be stored in a secondary root of
            trust (i.e., a ledger), and similar or identical resolver metadata could be returned by querying the same
            identifier there.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following field is not a core field in a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID document: <code>Services</code>.  The <tt>did:keri</tt> method
            is provided for interoperability for the purpose of using KERI to establish control authority of the current public keys associated
            with KERI identifier behind the <tt>keri:did</tt> DID.  It is anticipated that KERI tunnel methods (eg. <tt>did:indy:sov:keri</tt>) will
            provide these features to enable addition interop.

    <h2>The did:keri Format</h2>
    <p>The format for the <tt>did:keri</tt> method conforms to the [[DID-CORE]]
        specification and is simple. It consists of the <code>did:keri:</code> prefix,
        followed by the identifier prefix.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Method Name</h3>
        <p>The method name that identifies this DID method SHALL be: <code>keri</code></p>

        A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:keri:</code>. Per the DID specification, this
        string MUST be in lowercase.  The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is the method specific identifier (MSI) described below.
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Method Specific Identifier</h3>
        <p>The method specific identifier for the <tt>did:keri</tt> method is the prefix for a content self-addressing
            self-certifying identifier.</p>

        <p>A self-addressing, self-certifying identifier is cryptographically bound to the inception keys used to create it.  The
            rationale and process for the derivation of an identifier is described in detail in the
            <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0001.md#derivation-codes">Derivation Codes</a> section of [[KID0001]]</p>

        <h3>Create</h3>
        <p>
            Creation of a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID is accomplished by creating, signing and publishing an Inception event. If witnesses are listed
            in the inception event, the receipts are also required for DID creation to be complete.
        </p>

        <p>
            Detailed steps for prefix derivation are in [[KID0001]] and witness configuration in [[KID0009]].  Inception events are
            covered in [[KID0003]].

            Steps to resolve a `did:keri:$PREFIX` DID:
        <ol>
            <li>Find the Key Event Log for the prefix `$PREFIX`.  The method for discovering the Key Event Log is outside the scope of
                this specification.  Possible implementations include the use of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), anchoring a KEL in a ledger or the use of a gossip
                protocol involving a witness network.
            </li>
            <li>Process the KEL into a Key State, according to the state validation rules/semantics of KERI as defined in [[KID0008]]
            </li>
            <li>Create a DID Document with the DID `did:keri:$PREF`</li>
            <li>For each key K in the Key State, add a Verification Method to the DID Doc containing K and the
                appropriate type, with the ID of K being K's prefix form (alternatively, the ID could be an integer of
                K's index in the current signer list)
            </li>
            <li>Add the Key State as DID Document Metadata as defined in <a href="#resolvermetadata"></a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>

            Establishment of control authority can be done independently of DID document contents, as long as the Key
            State is provided in the DID Document Metadata. See <a href="#resolvermetadata"></a>.

        <h3>Update</h3>
        <p>
            Updating a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID is accomplished by publishing establishment events to the KEL for performing operations
            such as key rotation and updating signature thresholds, witnesses and delegates.
        </p>

            A detailed description of event types, their semantics and uses can be found in [[KID0003]].

        <h3>Deactivate</h3>
        <p>
            Deactivation of a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID consists of rotation to 0 controlling keys, which terminates the ability
            to recover the identifier and indicates that the identifier has been abandoned. Identifiers which are delegated
            to by an abandoned Identifier are also considered abandoned (delegating Ixn events can no longer be created).

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
    <p>
        A breakdown of the privacy considerations from [[RFC6973]] section 5 is provided below.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Surveillance</h3>
        <p>
            A robust witness network along with consistent witness rotation provides protection from monitoring and association of
            an individual's activity inside a KERI network.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Stored Data Compromise</h3>
        <p>
            For resolvers that simply discover the Key State endorsed by another party in a discovery network, caching policies
            of that network would guide stored data security considerations.  In the event that a resolver is also the endorsing party,
            meaning they have their own KERI identifier and are verifying the KEL and signing the Key State themselves, leveraging the
            facilities provided by the KERI protocol (key rotation, witness maintenance, multi-sig) should be used to protect the identities
            used to sign the Key State.
        </p>
        <p>
            See [[KID0005]] for information on KERI key rotation, [[KID0009]] for a discussion on witnesses and [[KID0004]] for KERI's support
            of multi-sig.

    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Unsolicited Traffic</h3>
        <p>
            DID Documents are not required to provide endpoints and thus not subject to unsolicited traffic.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Misattribution</h3>
        <p>
            This DID Method relies on KERI's duplicity detection to determine when the non-repudiable controller of a DID
            has been inconsistent and can no longer be trusted.  This establishment of non-repudiation enables consistent attribution.
        </p>

    <section id="correlation">
        <h3>Correlation</h3>
        <p>
            The root of trust for KERI identifiers is entropy and therefore offers no direct means of correlation.  In addition, KERI provides
            two modes of communication, direct mode and indirect mode.  Direct mode allows for pairwise (n-wise as well) relationships that
            can be used to establish private relationships.
        </p>

        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>
            The root of trust for KERI identifiers is entropy and therefore offers no direct means of identification.  In addition, KERI provides
            two modes of communication, direct mode and indirect mode.  Direct mode allows for pairwise (n-wise as well) relationships that

    <section>
        <h3>Secondary Use</h3>
        <p>
            The Key State made available in the metadata of this DID method is generally available and can be used by any party
            to retrieve and verify the state of the KERL for the given identifier.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="disclosure">
        <h3>Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
            No data beyond the Key State for the identifier is provided by this DID method.

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Exclusion</h3>
        <p>
            This DID method provides no opportunity for correlation (See <a href="#correlation"></a>), identification (See <a href="#identification"></a>) or
            disclosure (See <a href="#disclosure"></a>) and therefore there is no opportunity to exclude the controller from knowing about data that others have
            about them.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Key State Verification</h3>
        <p>
            Users of a <tt>did:keri</tt> did method resolver MUST verify the key state returned in the document metadata
            of the resolution result.  The signature of the resolver can be used to determine if the resolver is dysfunctional
            and should no longer be trusted.  However it should not be used to verify the key state.
        </p>

        <p>
            The only definitive method for verifying the key state is to pass the key state to a KERI library and perform the verification of
            that key state.
        </p>
    </section>

    <p>
        A breakdown of the security considerations from [[RFC3552]] is provided below.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Confidentiality Violations, Password Sniffing</h3>
        <p>
            All private keys used to establish control over the KERI identifier of a KERI DID method DID should be held secret.
            KERI's use of delegation ensures that private keys for each identifier never need to be transferred.  DID controllers
            can delegate levels of authority of other identities to enable remote agents.
        </p>

        <p>
            See [[KID0007]] for a discussion of delegation.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, pre-rotation mechanism provides key rotation capabilities while eliminating exposure of the next
            public key until it is rotated into the current signing key.  Enforcing key rotation for every event of a given identifier
            provides further protection against key exposure.
        </p>

        <p> See [[KID0005]] for a description of pre-rotation and the protections it provides</p>

    <section id="replayattacks">
        <h3>Replay Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            <tt>did:keri</tt> relies on the KERI protocol which is not susceptible to replay attacks.  The hash linking, signatures
            and sequence numbers of events ensures that replayed messages do not effect the protocol.
        </p>

        <p>See [[KID0003]] for a description of KERI events.</p>

    <section id="messageattacks">
        <h3>Message Insertion, Deletion, Modification</h3>
        <p>
            <tt>did:keri</tt> relies on the KERI protocol which is not susceptible to message deletion or modification attacks.
            The hash linking, signatures and sequence numbers of events ensures that messages can not be modified or deleted without immediate detection.
            In addition, KERI's duplicity detection mechanisms allow easy detection of inserted messages allowing validators to determine the consistency
            of a DID controller.

        <h3>Man-In-The-Middle Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            The protections mentioned in <a href="#replayattacks"></a> and <a href="#messageattacks"></a> render Man-In-The-Middle
            attacks ineffective against the KERI protocol and this DID Method.
